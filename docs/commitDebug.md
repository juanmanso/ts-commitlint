# ðŸ›  Commit debugging tool

To debug the `commitlint` tool, we use [`conventional-commits-parser`](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/tree/master/packages/conventional-commits-parser)
which takes a commit message string, and outputs the parsed object.

Identical to how `commitlint` works, `conventional-commits-parser` accepts a
configuration file (with the same format as `commitlint`) but instead of returning
an error, the parsed object is returned.

```bash
âžœ cat goodCommit.txt
feat(awesome feature): incorporate awesome feature to the repo

This awesome feature required a lot of work from the team and it will launch
the company to the moon. Special thanks to the team: @john, @paul, @george
and @ringo.

BREAKING CHANGE: this feature is so ground breaking, it actually adds breaking changes

Closed #JIRA-1234
```

```bash
âžœ yarn commitlint:debug goodCommit.txt | sed -n 4p | jq '.'
